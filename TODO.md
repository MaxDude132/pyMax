- implement lists (basics: push, pop, iterate) -- DONE
- implement for-loops -- DONE for lists only
- implement magic function iterate -- DONE
- remove semicolons and replace with endline -- DONE
- make float and int separate types -- DONE
- implement maps (basics: push, get, remove, iterate) -- DONE
